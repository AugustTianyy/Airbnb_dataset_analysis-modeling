# 🏡 Airbnb Dataset Analysis and Modeling
This project focuses on analyzing the Airbnb dataset using Python to identify key factors influencing pricing and to build predictive models. The analysis includes data cleaning, feature engineering, and applying various machine learning algorithms.

## 📊 Project Overview
- **Objective**: Identify key factors influencing Airbnb pricing and predict prices using machine learning models.  
- **Approach**: Utilized data analysis (Pandas, NumPy), visualization (Matplotlib, Seaborn), and machine learning models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Network).  
- **Outcome**: Achieved consistent performance across multiple models and provided insights into the impact of different features on pricing.  

## 📁 Files in Repository
- **data/**: Contains the Airbnb dataset (`AB_NYC_2019.csv`).  
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for data analysis and modeling.
